Almost every kid will be asked the question of whom do you like better, your mother or your father.
There is no doubt that mother is very great as she gives you the life, while father is also of importance.
Father's Day is invented to show gratitude to fathers. Its coming has a story.
The first person to propose the idea of Father's Day was Mrs. Dodd in 1906.
She wanted a special day to honor her father, whose wife passed away many years ago.
At first, Mrs. Dodd wanted Father's Day to be celebrated on her father's birthday, but later President Johnson signed a paper to declare the third Sunday of June was Father's Day.
Since then, it became an international day.
It is not only to honor one's father, but also the fathers of all the people.
Father's Day reminds people to show gratitude to their fathers, who loves you all the time and no matter what difficulty you meet, he will stand by your side.
So however busy we are, we should call them now and then.
